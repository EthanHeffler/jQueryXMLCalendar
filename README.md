jQueryXMLCalendar
=================

A client requested an event calendar that they could update using XML. After looking far and wide across the internet I couldn't find an example, so I built it myself. I was on a tight schedule so instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel and writing my own calendar scripts, I used the jQuery UI Datepicker plugin as a basis for the calendar. From there I had to rewrite all the out of the box styles that came with the plugin, then have the XML file with the dates load through an ajax function I wrote.
